This is a simple display test code for the 0.96-inch version of the SSD1306.

However, I am using the U8g2 library (instead of the standard SSD1306 library, as it tends to be more problematic).

Required Libraries
U8g2 by oliver

Hardware Requirements
0.96-inch OLED display (Note: This code works with other display sizes as well, but you will need to adjust the dimensions within the code.)

A microcontroller (ESP32, Raspberry Pi Pico, etc.)

Instructions
Once you have everything ready, simply upload the code and the text will appear. You can also modify the text to say whatever you’d like.
